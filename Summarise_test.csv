"Each evening Ali Baba went out to gather twigs and branches for his wife so that she had enough firewood to cook the stew for dinner.

One day, Ali Baba went further than usual to hunt for fallen branches beneath the trees that grew beside the rocky cliffs near the high hills.

Suddenly, he heard a great clatter of hooves on the rocky path. He was afraid. He climbed the nearest tree and hid among the leaves.

He was well hidden but was able to peer between the leaves. He was astonished to see a long line of men on horseback, riding one behind the other.

Ali Baba counted them as they rode beneath the tree where he hid.

‘One … two … three … four,’ and many, many more, until he had counted forty.

Finally, the forty riders reached a cliff face. They dismounted and removed the saddlebags from their horses’ backs. Ali Baba noticed that the bags were bulging.

‘Perhaps the bags are full of treasure,’ thought Ali Baba. ‘These men are thieves and robbers. Maybe they are about to hide their loot.’

The thieves lined up behind their leader. They were right in front of the steep rocky cliff.

‘How silly!’ Ali Baba thought. ‘There is nowhere to hide treasure here.’

At that moment, one of the riders spoke loudly.

'Open Sesame!' he cried.

Suddenly, a secret door in the rock opened. The forty riders entered a hidden cave. They were going to hide the treasure they had stolen.

When they were all inside, the leader shouted, ‘Close Sesame!’

The secret door closed again with the thieves hidden safely inside.

Ali Baba waited, hidden in his treetop until the riders came out of the cave again. He counted carefully to make sure that they were all out.

‘One … two … three … four,’ and many, many, many more until he reached thirty-nine.

Last of all came the leader. When he stood outside the cave, he again said, ‘Close Sesame!’

The secret rock door closed.

Ali Baba peered through the leaves. He was amazed to see how perfectly the door fitted into the rock.

The thieves put the empty saddlebags over their horses. Then they set off, one by one.

Ali Baba counted to make sure that they had all gone. ‘One … two … three … four,’ and many, many, many more until he reached forty. Then he listened until he could no longer hear any hooves clattering – he was safe!

Ali Baba climbed down the tree and walked up to the rocky cliff. He was curious to discover if the magic door would open for him if he said the special word. Would he be brave enough to try?

Ali Baba stood there. He looked at the rocky cliff. He thought about all the treasure in the cave, and he thought about the forty thieves. He couldn’t hear anything at all.

At last, he decided, ‘I must be safe now. So I shall be brave and say the magic words out loud.’

Then Ali Baba went close to the rocky cliff.

‘Open Sesame!’ he said. The door opened.

Ali Baba could see steps leading down. Little lamps of burning oil lit the stairway. He was just about to descend the steps when he remembered. The leader of the thieves had spoken two words to close the magic door.

Ali Baba decided that he should shut the magic door too. It would not be a good idea for anyone else to see the entrance to the cave of treasure.

‘Close Sesame!’ he cried, and the magic door slid shut.

After that, Ali Baba crept down the stone steps until he reached the treasure cave. He gazed all around in amazement. There were thousands of sparkling jewels in great heaps: diamonds, rubies, emeralds and every other sort of precious gem. Then there was gold! Ali Baba’s eyes grew wide in wonder when he saw the vast piles of gold coins.","One day, while Ali Baba was gathering firewood, he hid in a tree after hearing the sound of approaching horses. He watched as forty thieves arrived at a cliff face and, using the command ""Open Sesame,"" opened a secret door in the rock. The thieves, who were carrying bulging saddlebags, entered the cave and later emerged with empty bags after using the command ""Close Sesame"" to seal the entrance. Once the thieves were gone, Ali Baba went to the cliff and used the same magic words to open the door. He then entered the cave and was amazed to see vast piles of jewels and gold coins."
"The camel and the fox were very good friends and very good thieves. One day, the two friends decided to cross the river so that they could travel to a nearby farm to steal food. The small fox could not swim so the camel said to his friend, ‘Climb up onto my back and I will swim across the river.’

And so the fox climbed up onto the camel’s back and the strong camel swam across the river to the other side.

When they had crossed the river, the camel and the fox made their way to the farm. When they finally arrived at the farm, the fox caught herself a chicken while the camel dug up some lovely fresh vegetables.

The greedy fox quickly gobbled down her chicken and then said to her friend the camel, ‘When I finish eating I am accustomed to singing.’

‘Do not sing just yet,’ said the camel as he was chewing on his dinner of vegetables. ‘I have not yet finished eating and if you sing then the farmer will hear you. Let me first finish my dinner and then you can sing as we make our way back home.’

But the fox did not pay any attention to her friend and began to sing at the top of her voice. The farmer soon heard this singing and came running out of his house waving a large stick.

‘I will teach you to steal from me!’ exclaimed the angry farmer.

Because the fox was so small and nimble, she was able to run away from the farmer. But the poor camel was very slow, and still in the middle of eating his dinner, and so he did not see the farmer until it was too late.

The angry famer set upon the camel with his large stick and the poor camel received many blows to his legs and back before he was finally able to escape.

When the camel reached the river, his bones ached and he was very upset with his friend the fox.

‘Why did you sing when you knew that farmer would hear you and you could see that I was still eating my dinner?’ asked the camel.

‘Because it is my custom,’ replied the fox in her matter-of-fact way. ‘Now let me climb upon your back so that we may return to our home across the river.’

Then the camel walked slowly down the riverbank into the water and began to swim across to the other side with the fox upon his back.

When the camel was halfway across the river, at the point where the water was at its deepest and the current at its fastest, he stopped swimming and said to the fox, ‘When I have finished eating I am accustomed to taking a bath.’","A camel and a fox, who were friends and thieves, crossed a river so they could steal food from a farm. The fox, unable to swim, rode on the camel's back. At the farm, the fox quickly ate its chicken and then, despite the camel's warning, began to sing loudly. The farmer heard the fox and chased them with a stick. The nimble fox escaped, but the slow camel was beaten by the farmer. Later, as they were crossing the river to go home, the camel, still upset, told the fox that it was his custom to take a bath after eating, and he stopped swimming while they were in the deepest part of the river."
"South Africa’s rulers are so detached from their electorate they don’t even let them eat cake. Lebohang Liepollo Pheko explains.

Every year on the weekend closest to January 8th, the African National Congress (ANC) gathers to commemorate its formation on that date in 1912. The commemoration has evolved into a carnival-like political pilgrimage to branded black, green and yellow stadiums for the party faithful. 

A feature of these festivities is the ritualistic cake cutting.

At some point towards the end of the day, after speeches peppered with hollow promises and contrition for things that have not gone to plan, in the sweltering South African summer that January brings, a huge cake emerges.

On the shaded stage the ANC party higher-ups cut the cake and distribute it generously – but only among themselves. Smiling joyfully, the leadership slice the cake, pause for cameras and pass pieces in full view of thousands of ANC members who are largely unwaged workers who borrow and save to find means to travel to the annual political party pilgrimage.","The African National Congress (ANC) holds an annual commemoration event in South Africa, where party leaders cut a large cake. However, the cake is not shared with the thousands of party members in attendance, most of whom are unwaged workers who have made sacrifices to be there. Instead, the leaders share the cake only among themselves on a shaded stage, in full view of the crowd."
"Since privatisation there has been a migration of the sector towards a model of private finance and a rise in Private Equity (PE), sovereign wealth fund and pension fund investors, which has become very common in the infrastructure sector globally. 

As of 2021, only three privatised companies remain listed on the London Stock Exchange, three are delisted and the other nine are owned by Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) companies. Currently, more than 70% of the sector is owned by overseas investors. 

Allied with this migration is a growth in the complexity of company structures and a rapid change in the way that debt is utilised. Several companies from the early 2000s have used a structure called Whole Business Securitisation’ (WBS). This model can take advantage of the fact that a company with higher debt loadings can be allied with more “steady” credit ratings, given the secure future income stream from customers. The WBS model also allows for increased returns on investment. ","Since its privatization, the infrastructure sector has seen a major shift towards a model of private financing, attracting investors such as private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds, and pension funds. As of 2021, most privatized companies are no longer listed on the London Stock Exchange, with over 70% now owned by overseas investors. This shift has led to more complex company structures and a greater use of debt, particularly through a model called ""Whole Business Securitisation"" (WBS), which allows companies to take on more debt while maintaining a stable credit rating due to a secure future income stream from customers."
"First of all, the setting up of sector-specific guidances and criteria is burdened with the necessity of defining measurable and comparable benchmarks for a notoriously complex and opaque financial world. In addition compliance with these criteria cannot be enforced and depends on the good faith of its members. In part these problems emerge, because the financial institutions are not the primary sources of carbon emissions. They are only addressing the “financed emissions”, the emissions attributed to financial institutions from their lending and investments. So, short-term lending for long-term infrastructure, like liquefied natural gas terminals, will show only the short-term effects for the time it takes to pay the loans back. Furthermore, the financial institutions refer to the difficulties of getting accurate emissions data from their clients. 

More general methodological problems are linked to inadequate timelines, coverage and targets. For example, only one sector set a target for 2025, necessary to assess whether its members meet the Return to Zero-requirement of a 50% reduction by 2030. We also find the case of the NZAM sector targets are based not on actual reductions to their financed emissions, but on the percentage of their assets under management (AUM) which is supposedly aligned to net zero.

The UN Race to Zero campaign has put GFANZ under pressure by issuing tougher criteria, following Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ statement that fossil-fuel companies and their financiers “have humanity by the throat”. It triggered a reaction of the chair of the banking sector NZBA, underlining its autonomy and stating that “Race to Zero does not have the ability to impose requirements either on the NZBA as a whole or on individual members”.","Financial institutions face significant challenges in creating and enforcing sector-specific guidelines for ""financed emissions."" This is due to the difficulty of setting measurable benchmarks and the reliance on members' good faith, as the institutions themselves are not the primary source of carbon emissions. Additionally, there are methodological problems with inadequate timelines and targets, such as sectors not having a 2025 target to measure progress toward a 50% reduction by 2030. Some targets are based on the percentage of assets aligned with net zero rather than actual emissions reductions. The UN's ""Race to Zero"" campaign has introduced stricter criteria, but financial groups like the NZBA are asserting their autonomy and resisting these new requirements."
