"When I read this book I had to keep reminding myself that it was about a real person not a fictional character. It was hard to believe that the women of Saudi Arabia are treated in such an inhumane way. The book is just so incredible. A co-worker also read this book and when our boss would go into one of his tirants we would say to each other, ""at least we're not living in Saudia Arabia."" That's how bad life is for women in that country. They seem to be viewed and treated as property not people.",1
"I know if you're a conservative, you'll think this is just another liberal's comment. But I am personally sick of right-wing lies that are getting spewed in the media like so many 4-year olds' tantrums called ""we want our own way!"" Franken busts them one by one. It's refreshing in this suffocating political climate of lies, fear, hate and death. In these serious times, it's nice to have a little humor along with the real facts to lighten things up. I just sent ten of these books to my friend as a gift to pass out to his friends.",1
I love this movie. Can't say that enough. Rick Moranis as a federal agent is still and lovable. Steve Martin as a fast talking ganster will make your side hurt from laughing. What makes this movie great though is that the whole family can see it. The price makes it a must have for the home collection.,1
"When I first saw Sayles film ""Lone Star,"" it touched me on a level I couldn't even fully explain. When I saw Limbo I was amazed that he'd done it to me again! Limbo is painted with rich textures, sounds that haunt you and the earnest feeling that you actually know these people. I felt as if I was there with them, my life threatened and frightened. Who would have thought that a young girl reading from a diary would contain more raw power and intensity than a Schwarzenegger movie?--another masterpiece of filmmaking by a master director.",1
"It is one of the greatest operas, the production is fine, the singers and orchestra perform wonderfully. With all the crazy productions around, this one is well worth the price",1
"I bought this vacuum when my Windtunnel kept malfunctioning. I thought I would buy a nice cheap vacuum this time after investing in the more expensive Windtunnel. This vacuum is NOT for pet owners. The canister is small and fills up almost instantly. You need to empty it after every room and it is messy to empty. The filter clogs constantly. The attachments are clumsy and hard to use. My preteen son used it in his room and didn't realize the canister was full because it is hard to see in. When we emptied the canister it spilled everywhere. The vacuum is useless on hardwoods, and even on carpets it spits back hairballs.Don't waste your money on this.",0
"I loved THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL and was excited to start this one. Disappointment is an understatement. I find it difficult to enjoy a book in which I have no sympathy for the heroine. I'm turning the pages only because I can't wait for her to get what's coming to her, only it can't come soon enough. Beatrice's lies, incest and selfishness drag on for pages and pages and pages. Needless to say, I will not be reading the next books in this series since I'm struggling to finish this one.",0
"[...] I have never met Mr. Li Hongzhi, but i can tell you that his philosophy and moral guidance has made me all the more, truthful, compassionate, and tolerant. This book should receive no stars because it is simply a propaganda tool by the persecutors of Falun Gong, namely the CCP.",0
"Much of the ""blame"" for the change in HP can certainly be shared by ex-CEO John Young and his board - in a major strategic shift, Young famously declared in 1989 that ""HP is a computer company"". But Perfect Enough reads as little more than a whitewash of Ms. Fiorina's role and behavior since she joined the company - rushed into print because a less flattering book was in the works? Read Backfire instead.",0
"Seriously Jamey Jasta, give up the image. Your not tough, you wont beat us all up, your music is not ""br00tal"", and you still live with your mother.Do not listen to Hatebreed, do not wear Hatebreed shirts, do not go to Hatebreed shows. It makes it seem like theyre actually good, or that Jamey Jasta has friends.",0
One of the things I like about Mr. Jennings work is that he manages to describe the cultures he writes about in the contex of that culture. It's rare to be thrown so completely into a world that no longer exists and discover only when you've put the book down that you had left your own world and all its judgmental comparisons behind for a few hours.,1
